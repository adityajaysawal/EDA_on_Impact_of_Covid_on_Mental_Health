### COVID-19 Impact on Mental Health: Maternal Health and Socioeconomic Factors

This project explores the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, focusing on maternal health during pregnancy and the influence of household income on anxiety and depression. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations that highlight key risk factors associated with maternal age, income, and mental health during the pandemic.

#### Key Insights:

- **Maternal Age and Health Risks**: 
  - Women aged 25-38 are less likely to experience anxiety or postpartum depression.
  - Conceiving after age 42 significantly increases the risk of premature births (less than 7.5 months gestation).
  - A notable 13% increase in C-sections after age 38, likely due to physiological changes.
  - Significant association found between maternal age and newborn health (NICU stay, unhealthy weight), but not height.

- **Household Income and Mental Health**: 
  - Individuals below the poverty line ($70,000) are significantly more susceptible to anxiety and high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores.
  - Income is positively correlated with reduced mental health risks; higher-income individuals show a 33% probability of anxiety and depression.
  - Universal concerns about newborn health during the pandemic, regardless of income.
  - Education and income interplay: Both are significant in determining levels of anxiety and depression.
  - Women with high EPDS scores have an 81% likelihood of high anxiety, compounding mental health challenges during the pandemic.

This analysis highlights the complex interaction between maternal age, income, and the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health. It provides a valuable perspective for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers working to address maternal mental health and socioeconomic disparities during public health crises.
